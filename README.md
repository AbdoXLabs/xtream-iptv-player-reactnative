# xtream-iptv-player-reactnative

React Native iOS/Android/Web app that allows you to watch IPTV streams from Xtream-Codes IPTV panel.

DISCLAIMER: THIS APP DOESN'T CONTAIN STREAMS, NEITHER PROVIDES ACCESS TO STREAMS

# Since a lot of people apparently can't try/do shit on their own and keep nagging my soul, this app is ejected from CRNA and uses React Native + ExpoKit. Figure it out. Hint: https://expo.io/
